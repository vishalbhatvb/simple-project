1. Create Dockerfile: Define your application's Dockerfile to build an image.

2. Build and Push Docker Image:
   - Use Jenkins to build the Docker image from the Dockerfile.
   - Push the built Docker image to a container registry (like Docker Hub or a private registry).

3. Setup Minikube:
	kubectl create namespace argocd
   - Start Minikube on your Ubuntu server.
   - Configure `kubectl` to use the Minikube context.
	Minikube is a local Kubernetes cluster that helps you develop and test Kubernetes applications on your own machine.

4. Install Argo CD:
   - Deploy Argo CD on Minikube.
   - Access the Argo CD UI

5. Create Helm Chart:
   - Create a Helm chart for your application, defining deployments, services, and other Kubernetes resources.

6. Configure Helm Chart:
   - Include values in your Helm chart that reference your Docker image.
   - Define PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) if needed.

7. Deploy Helm Chart with Argo CD:
   - Use Argo CD to manage and deploy the Helm chart to your Minikube cluster.
   - Set up GitOps by connecting your Helm chart repository to Argo CD.

8. Monitor and Manage:
   - Monitor the deployment status through the Argo CD dashboard.

you can set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, build and push a Docker image, configure Minikube, 
deploy and manage your application using Helm and Argo CD, and monitor your deployment effectively.
